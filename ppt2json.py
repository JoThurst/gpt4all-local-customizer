# You can achieve this by following these steps:

# 1. Extract text from PowerPoint:
# Use a library like python-pptx to extract text from PowerPoint slides and store it in a JSON format.

# 2. Prepare data for AI/ML:
# Convert the extracted text from the PowerPoint into a format suitable for input to your AI/ML model. This might involve preprocessing steps like tokenization, removing stopwords, or vectorization.

# 3. Train or use a pre-trained model:
# Train your own AI/ML model on a dataset of relevant content if you have labeled data. Alternatively, you can use pre-trained models like BERT or T5 for text summarization tasks.

# 4. Feed data to the model:
# Feed the preprocessed text data into your AI/ML model for text summarization. This may involve using the model's API if it's available, or running inference directly if you have the model locally.

# 5. Generate condensed output:
# Process the output from the model to generate a condensed and formatted summary of the most relevant content. You may need to post-process the model output to improve readability and coherence.

# Here's a basic example using python-pptx to extract text from PowerPoint:

from pptx import Presentation
import json

def extract_text_from_powerpoint(pptx_file):
    prs = Presentation(pptx_file)
    text_content = []
    for slide in prs.slides:
        for shape in slide.shapes:
            if hasattr(shape, "text"):
                text_content.append(shape.text)
    return text_content

pptx_file = "pokemon-trivia.pptx"
text_data = extract_text_from_powerpoint(pptx_file)

# Now, you can store the extracted text data into a JSON file.
with open("text_data.json", "w") as json_file:
    json.dump(text_data, json_file)

# After extracting the text data, you can proceed with preprocessing, model training, or using pre-trained models for text summarization as described above.
